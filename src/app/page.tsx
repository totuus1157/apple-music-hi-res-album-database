            Due to a complete overhaul, previously registered album data can no
            longer be deleted. Additionally, not all album data could be
            migrated due to my residential area constraints. I apologize for any
            inconvenience this may cause.

            Why I Created This Service
          </h2>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-800 leading-8">
            Apple launched high-resolution lossless distribution of Apple Music
            in June 2021. However, a way to directly search for high-resolution
            music sources has yet to be provided.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-800 leading-8 mt-6">
            So I thought it would be very useful to have a database where Apple
            Music users could register and share high-resolution albums that
            they know, and I actually developed it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-800 leading-8 mt-6">
            Of course, I understand that sound quality is not the most important
            criterion for evaluating a piece of music.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-800 leading-8 mt-6">
            However, I believe that the desire for better sound quality is
            rooted in the natural instincts of human beings, and above all, it
            would be wonderful if this service could help us discover unknown
            and amazing music that we have never had the chance to experience in
            the culture we grew up in.
          </p>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-800 leading-8 mt-6">
            If you know of a high-resolution album that has not yet been
            registered in this database, please add it. Any small contribution
            would be greatly appreciated.
          </p>
