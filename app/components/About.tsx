        Apple launched high-resolution lossless distribution of Apple Music in
        June of 2021. However, a way to directly search for high-resolution
        music sources has yet to be provided to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I thought it would be very useful to have a database where Apple
        Music users could register and share high-resolution albums that they
        know, and I actually developed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I know that sound quality is not the most important criterion
        for evaluating a piece of music.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I believe that the desire for better sound quality is rooted in
        the natural instincts of human beings, and above all, it would be
        wonderful if this service could help us encounter unknown and amazing
        music that we have never had the chance to experience in the culture we
        grew up in.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know of a high-resolution album that has not yet been registered
        to this database, please add it. Any small contribution would be greatly
        appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>Let&apos;s enjoy together the common language of the world, music!</p>
